# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `NamespaceCache::close()` flushes the foyer NVMe write buffer and shuts the cache down cleanly, so entries inserted before the call are durable on disk. Groundwork for graceful shutdown (#13).
- `NamespaceManager::generation()` returns a namespace's cache generation, derived from its Lance table version and the manifest commit timestamp, and `NamespaceCache::set_generation()` seeds the shared generation counter from it. The query read path now derives the cache key's generation from this persistent value rather than a process-local counter (see Fixed).

### Changed
- Building an index (IVF_PQ, FTS, or scalar BTree) now invalidates a namespace's cached query results. An index build is a Lance commit that advances the table version, which is the cache generation, so post-build queries re-run against the new index instead of replaying a pre-index cached result. Previously index builds left the cache untouched. Index builds are infrequent and operator-triggered, so dropping the warm cache afterwards is a minor cost for the safer behaviour.

### Fixed
- The result cache could serve stale results after a process restart. The per-namespace generation counter that keys cached entries lived only in memory and reset to 0 on restart, while the foyer NVMe tier persists and recovers its entries on reopen — so a repeat query at a replayed generation could be served a result from before a write that had already bumped the generation. The generation is now derived from the Lance table version, a persistent value that advances on every commit, so a recovered NVMe entry is reachable only when the namespace has not changed since the entry was stored. The generation also folds in the manifest commit timestamp, so deleting a namespace and recreating it under the same name cannot serve the deleted incarnation's cached results even when the new incarnation reaches the same Lance version. Reproduced by `crates/firnflow-core/tests/cache_restart_staleness.rs` and `tests/service_cache_aside.rs::delete_recreate_does_not_serve_old_incarnation`.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- **Opt-in semantic cache.** `POST /ns/{ns}/query` now accepts a `semantic_cache: { "enabled": true, "min_similarity": 0.995 }` block. When set, a query that misses the exact result cache will look for a previous query against the same namespace generation whose vector is within `min_similarity` cosine of the incoming one and whose surrounding shape (`k`, `nprobes`) matches; if found, the cached top-k bytes are reused. The default behaviour is unchanged — requests without the field, or with `enabled: false`, only short-circuit on exact-cache hits. v1 only applies to single-vector queries with no text/filters; multivector, FTS, and hybrid queries with the field enabled return 400 with a clear error. The default cosine threshold is 0.995; per-request overrides must lie in `(0.0, 1.0]`.
- `firnflow_semantic_cache_hits_total{namespace}`, `firnflow_semantic_cache_misses_total{namespace}`, and `firnflow_semantic_cache_rejections_total{namespace, reason}` Prometheus counters expose semantic-layer behaviour. `reason` is one of `unsupported_query_shape` or `empty_index` — bounded set so cardinality stays manageable.
- `firnflow_core` exports `SemanticCacheRequest`, `validate_semantic_cache_request`, `effective_semantic_threshold`, and `DEFAULT_SEMANTIC_MIN_SIMILARITY` for callers that want to build the request struct directly (the bench harness, custom clients).
- `crates/firnflow-core/tests/service_semantic_cache.rs` and `crates/firnflow-api/tests/api_semantic_cache.rs` cover the new behaviour at the service and HTTP boundaries: exact-hit short-circuit, near-duplicate hit, opt-out bypass, k mismatch, write invalidation, ineligible-shape 400, and the `firnflow_semantic_cache_hits_total` metric surfacing through `/metrics`.

### Changed
- `QueryRequest` gains an `Option<SemanticCacheRequest>` field, defaulted to `None`. Existing JSON callers see no change. The exact-cache hash deliberately excludes the new field — toggling opt-in semantic caching does not split otherwise-identical entries; cached results from before this release stay reachable.
- `NamespaceCache` gains `try_get`, `populate_with_generation`, and `generation_counter` so the service can interleave the semantic-cache lookup between exact miss and backend call without duplicating the existing generation discipline. The legacy `get_or_populate` is unchanged and still drives the per-namespace invalidation tests.
- `NamespaceService::upsert`, `delete`, and `compact` invalidate the semantic sidecar in the same step they invalidate the exact cache. Index builds (`create_index`, `create_fts_index`, `create_scalar_index`) do **not** invalidate either layer — the underlying data is unchanged.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- `FIRNFLOW_MAX_BODY_BYTES` env var raises the request body limit applied to every JSON endpoint. Defaults to 16 MB, up from axum's 2 MB. The previous default was below the size of a single multivector row at typical late-interaction dimensions (around 300-512 sub-vectors of dimension 128 is roughly 2 MB once JSON-encoded), so any practical batch upsert was failing with 413 before the handler had a chance to run. Single-vector workloads also benefit at larger batch sizes. Operators wanting a tighter ceiling lower it; operators wanting more headroom raise it. Refs #54.
- Optional `num_bits` field on `POST /ns/{namespace}/index`. Accepted values are `4` and `8`; omitting the field keeps Lance's existing 8-bit default. 4-bit codes halve the per-vector index storage at the cost of some recall, and additionally require `num_sub_vectors` to be even (Lance rejects 4-bit PQ over an odd sub-vector count). Validation runs synchronously before the background index task is spawned, so a bad payload returns 400 instead of a misleading 202 followed by a log-only failure. The same `firnflow_core::validate_ivf_pq_options` helper is also called inside `NamespaceManager::create_index`, so direct callers from `firnflow-bench` and integration tests get the same up-front rejection. Refs #54.

### Changed
- Default request body limit changed from axum's 2 MB to 16 MB. Existing operators inherit the new default automatically; nothing breaks at the previous limit, larger batches simply succeed now.
- `NamespaceManager::create_index` and `NamespaceService::create_index` gained a fourth parameter, `num_bits: Option<u32>`. All in-tree call sites pass `None` to preserve today's behaviour.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- **Multivector namespaces.** Each namespace is now one of two vector kinds — *single-vector* (the existing behaviour, one dense vector per row, `FixedSizeList<Float32, dim>`) or *multivector* (a variable-length bag of small fixed-dimension sub-vectors per row, `List<FixedSizeList<Float32, dim>>`, scored by MaxSim). The multivector shape is what ColBERT, ColPali, and ColQwen2 produce; it gives compositional queries (e.g. *"a man with a logo on his shirt"*) the ability to match each query element independently instead of collapsing the whole query into one summary vector. The kind is determined by the first upsert into a namespace and is immutable thereafter. Single-vector callers continue to use `vector: [f32, ...]`; multivector callers use `vectors: [[f32, ...], ...]`. The payload shape must match the namespace kind on every subsequent request — a mismatched payload returns 400 with the expected shape named in the error. lancedb's index code path is unchanged (`Index::IvfPq` works for both kinds; Lance dispatches the late-interaction scoring path automatically from the column type), and the existing RRF auto-hybrid keeps working when multivector and FTS are combined on the same query. Lance's late-interaction index supports cosine distance exclusively; `IndexRequest` does not expose a metric override on the API surface, so `create_index` simply constructs the IVF_PQ builder with cosine internally when the column is multivector and with L2 otherwise.
- `VectorKind` enum exported from `firnflow_core` with `Single` and `Multivector` variants, plus `NamespaceManager::kind_for(&NamespaceId)` to read a namespace's resolved kind. The kind is inferred from the Lance table's vector column type at open time and cached alongside the existing dim.
- New `query_type` Prometheus label value: `"multivector"`, distinct from `"vector"` / `"fts"` / `"hybrid"`. A multivector + FTS query is labelled `"hybrid"` (consistent with the existing single-vector + FTS behaviour); a pure multivector query is labelled `"multivector"` so dashboards can isolate the late-interaction latency from regular cosine.
- `crates/firnflow-core/tests/manager_multivector.rs` and `crates/firnflow-api/tests/api_multivector.rs` — manager-level and API-level integration tests covering the full multivector lifecycle: round-trip upsert + index + query, kind/dim inference, mismatched payload rejection, empty inner list rejection, mixed inner dim rejection, "both `vector` and `vectors` set" rejection, and cosine-forcing on `create_index`. 7 manager tests + 6 API tests, all running against MinIO.

### Changed
- `QueryRequest` gains a `vectors: Option<Vec<Vec<f32>>>` field alongside the existing `vector: Vec<f32>`. The two fields are mutually exclusive; setting both returns 400. Bincode encoding of the request struct now includes the new field, so cached query results from before this release become unreachable by key and are reclaimed by foyer's normal LFU/LRU policy — no explicit cache flush required.
- `UpsertRow` (both the core type and the API DTO) gains the same `vectors: Option<Vec<Vec<f32>>>` field. The `From<(u64, Vec<f32>)>` impl is preserved so existing single-vector test patterns continue to compile unchanged.
- `NamespaceManager::query` signature widens to `query(&NamespaceId, vector: Vec<f32>, vectors: Option<Vec<Vec<f32>>>, k: usize, nprobes: Option<usize>, text: Option<String>)`. All in-tree call sites and integration tests were migrated in the same change.
- `NamespaceManager::create_index` constructs the IVF_PQ builder with `DistanceType::Cosine` for multivector namespaces and `DistanceType::L2` for single-vector namespaces. `IndexRequest` exposes `kind`, `num_partitions`, and `num_sub_vectors` only — there is no per-request metric option, so this is a defaulting choice keyed on the namespace kind, not an override of any caller input. Lance's late-interaction index only supports cosine; this is the implementation detail that makes the absence of a metric option safe.
- `NamespaceManager::query` builds multivector queries via `nearest_to(subs[0])` plus `add_query_vector(subs[1..])` and an explicit `.column("vector")`. lancedb 0.27.2's auto-detect for `nearest_to` walks top-level `FixedSizeList` columns and skips `List<FixedSizeList<...>>`; the explicit column hint plus the per-sub-vector pushes are how the upstream API expresses MaxSim late-interaction queries. The flat-slice "auto-reshape" path described in some external write-ups is not how lancedb 0.27 actually works — Lance's scanner hard-rejects mismatched query dims at the lower layer.
- `QueryResult.vector` is intentionally empty for multivector hits. A ColPali row's bag is hundreds of KB; echoing it back on every result would balloon response sizes by orders of magnitude with no obvious caller benefit. Single-vector hits continue to carry the stored vector. `ListRow.vector` follows the same convention.
- README gains a `## Multivector namespaces` section explaining the two kinds, the cosine-only constraint, the storage cost reality (single-vector CLIP at ~2 KB/row vs multivector ColPali at ~500 KB/row), and the "build an index for tractable production latency" guidance (un-indexed multivector queries are correct but brute-force, same trade-off as single-vector). `docs/api.html` documents both wire shapes and the new validation errors.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- `FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI` is the preferred way to point firnflow at object storage. It accepts a URI of the form `scheme://bucket[/prefix...]` and resolves into a `StorageRoot` that the namespace manager threads through every operation: connection URI for `lancedb::connect`, object-store-relative paths for `delete()`, and a scheme tag the manager dispatches on when picking an `object_store` builder. Multi-segment prefixes are supported (`s3://my-bucket/tenants/acme/prod` or `gs://my-bucket/tenants/acme/prod`) for operators sharing a bucket across deployments; trailing slashes are canonicalised away so `s3://foo` and `s3://foo/` parse to the same root. Both `s3://` (any S3-compatible backend) and `gs://` (native Google Cloud Storage) are routable schemes. Refs #37.
- Native Google Cloud Storage routing. `FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI=gs://bucket[/prefix...]` is a fully-supported configuration: lancedb resolves the URI through its own `gcs` feature, and `NamespaceManager`'s delete path uses the matching `object_store::gcp::GoogleCloudStorage` client. Both clients authenticate from the standard Google env vars: service-account JSON via `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH` (file path) or `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` (inline JSON), or any valid application-default-credentials file via `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (which may resolve to a service-account JSON, federated identity, user creds, etc.). The two are distinct setter paths in the object-store delete client — collapsing them would mean an ADC file that is not itself a raw service-account JSON would authenticate the connect path but fail the delete path. An operator only configures credentials once and gets both halves of the routing for free. This is the path Firn writes go through end-to-end — the GCS S3-interop endpoint is a deliberately separate (and known-broken) layer, not the path this URI hits. GCS is supported ✅ in the compatibility matrix as of this release; see the matrix-flip bullet below for the gating stress evidence. Refs #37.
- `crates/firnflow-core/tests/lance_concurrent_writes.rs` — two new `#[ignore]`'d native-GCS concurrent-writer tests (`concurrent_writers_preserve_all_rows_gcs_native` and `concurrent_writers_100_runs_gcs_native`) that mirror the AWS / R2 / Tigris / Spaces 8-writer × 100-row pattern but use `gs://{GCS_BUCKET}` so Lance routes through its native GCS backend (generation precondition `x-goog-if-generation-match: 0` on the GCS XML API). The existing S3-interop `_gcs` tests are kept in place as failure evidence. A new `gcs_native_storage_options()` helper forwards `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` / `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH` / `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` to the same setters the production builder uses, so the stress exercises the production code path rather than a test-only client. 100-run stress passed cleanly against `firn-gcs-bucket-europe-west1` (single-region, `europe-west1`) on 2026-05-11 in 825 seconds wall-clock — 80,000 rows written across the runs with zero lost writers. Refs #37.
- `crates/firnflow-core/src/storage_root.rs` — `StorageRoot` / `Scheme` types with table-driven unit tests covering parser edge cases (empty input, missing separator, empty bucket, unknown scheme), trailing-slash canonicalisation, multi-segment prefixes, the namespace URI and object-store-path helpers for both `s3://` and `gs://`, and the `s3://`/`gs://` scheme dispatch. Twenty-four unit tests in total, all running with no infrastructure dependency.
- `crates/firnflow-api/tests/config_storage_root.rs` — integration tests for the storage-root resolver covering the five precedence branches (URI only, bucket only, both-agree, both-disagree, neither), the normalised-comparison rule that recognises `FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI=s3://foo` and `FIRNFLOW_S3_BUCKET=foo` as the same root, empty-string-as-unset handling, and that `gs://` URIs resolve cleanly to the native-GCS scheme. Ten tests; the resolver is exposed publicly via `firnflow_api::config::{resolve_storage_root, ResolvedStorageRoot}` so the suite drives it without round-tripping through process-global env vars.
- `crates/firnflow-core/tests/gcs_native_connect.rs` — one `#[ignore]`'d smoke test that opens a `lancedb::connect("gs://...")` round-trip and lists tables, asserting the native GCS backend is wired correctly once the `gcs` feature is enabled. Gates on `GCS_BUCKET` plus one of the standard `GOOGLE_*` credential env vars; SKIPs cleanly when either is unset. Passing run against `firn-gcs-bucket-europe-west1` on 2026-05-11.

### Changed
- `FIRNFLOW_S3_BUCKET` continues to work but is now framed as the legacy fallback for `FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI`. When only the legacy var is set, startup emits one `INFO` log naming the preferred var; both vars are supported indefinitely (this is a preference hint, not a deprecation warning). When both are set, the resolver compares them as parsed `StorageRoot` values — `FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI=s3://foo` and `FIRNFLOW_S3_BUCKET=foo` are recognised as agreeing under the parser's trailing-slash canonicalisation — and uses the URI version silently; disagreement is a hard startup failure that names both raw values so the operator can see which one to fix. The "neither set" error message now names both env vars instead of only the legacy one.
- `NamespaceManager::new` takes a `StorageRoot` rather than a bucket string. The change is mechanical for callers that previously passed `bucket_name` — replace with `StorageRoot::s3_bucket(name)?` — and `tests/common::test_state()` already does this, so integration tests pick the change up automatically. Every `#[ignore]`'d real-S3 integration test was migrated in the same change.
- `firnflow-bench` now accepts `FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI` in addition to the legacy `FIRNFLOW_S3_BUCKET`, with the URI form taking precedence when both are set. This keeps the "config-only backend choice" promise consistent between the API and the bench — an operator running a bench against a fixed-prefix root (e.g. `s3://shared-bucket/tenants/acme/prod`) gets the same target the API would resolve. The bench applies a simpler precedence than the API resolver (URI wins; no strict disagreement check) because it is a dev tool, not a deployment surface.
- `FirnflowError::Unsupported` now renders as `unsupported: {msg}` (was `not supported in this build: {msg}`). The neutral prefix reads sensibly for both callers — startup-time storage URI rejection and namespace-level schema-pre-dates-feature operations like `/list` on tables without `_ingested_at`. HTTP response bodies are unchanged: the API layer wraps the inner message with its own `not supported:` 501 formatter, not the `Display` form.
- Workspace `lancedb` dependency now carries `features = ["aws", "gcs"]` (was `["aws"]` only), enabling `lance-io`'s native Google Cloud Storage backend. Workspace `object_store` likewise moves to `["aws", "gcp"]`, so the namespace delete path can reach a `gs://` bucket through the matching `object_store::gcp` client rather than the broken GCS S3-interop layer. The dev-only `object_store = { workspace = true, features = ["gcp"] }` override that previously lived in `firnflow-core`'s `[dev-dependencies]` is removed — redundant now that the workspace dep carries `gcp` directly. Exact-pinning on `lancedb = "=0.27.2"` is unchanged.
- `AppConfig` now picks the storage-options block by scheme. S3-family backends keep the `FIRNFLOW_S3_*` env-var translation; native GCS forwards `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` / `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH` / `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` through to lancedb and the object-store delete client unmodified (those are the standard variables the underlying clients already read). An operator switching from S3 to GCS sets `FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI=gs://bucket` and a service-account JSON; everything else falls into place.
- `scripts/cargo` learns to forward `FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI` to the dev container, and only defaults `FIRNFLOW_S3_BUCKET=firnflow-test` when the host has not picked a backend at all. Forwarding the legacy default unconditionally would collide with `FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI=gs://...` and trip the resolver's strict-disagreement check at startup; the conditional default keeps the existing MinIO-compose dev flow working while making the wrapper transparent to a `gs://`-configured operator.
- Two ignored tests that verify GCS's native conditional-write precondition (`x-goog-if-generation-match: 0` on the GCS XML API) through the `object_store::gcp` client with `PutMode::Create`, both passing cleanly against `firn-gcs-bucket` on 2026-05-10. `crates/firnflow-core/tests/s3_conditional_writes.rs` now contains a sequential pre-flight (two creates against the same key — the first must succeed, the second must surface as `object_store::Error::AlreadyExists`) and a contended-key microstress (8 writers, gated on a `tokio::sync::Barrier`, race the same key for 100 iterations; exactly one wins, the other seven each see `AlreadyExists`). Distinct-key stress is omitted on purpose — every writer succeeds when there is no contention, so it does not exercise CAS at all. The tests run against a service-account JSON via `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (or `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH` / `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`) plus `GCS_BUCKET`. They share the same code path that native-GCS Firn support relies on, so the verification exercises the production mechanism rather than a third-party HTTP shape. `scripts/cargo` mounts a service-account JSON into the dev container and passes the standard `GOOGLE_*` env vars through, so the new tests can be run end-to-end through the existing toolchain wrapper. These tests are precondition evidence for the Lance-level concurrent-writer stress that lands in the same release and flips GCS to ✅ in the compatibility matrix. Closes #36.
- README compatibility matrix flipped: native Google Cloud Storage (`gs://...`) now reads ✅, supported by the 100-run Lance-level concurrent-writer stress on `firn-gcs-bucket-europe-west1`. Single row only — the GCS S3-interop endpoint (`s3://` plus a custom `GCS_ENDPOINT`) remains unsupported and is called out in the row's footnote, because that path silently drops `If-None-Match: *`. A new `## Backend Configuration` section immediately follows the matrix with copy-paste env-var recipes for AWS S3, MinIO, R2, Tigris, DigitalOcean Spaces, and native GCS, so the "config-only backend choice" promise sits next to the matrix that documents which backends qualify. Refs #37.
- Documentation site updates. `docs/configuration.html` leads with `FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI` and adds a Google Cloud Storage subsection covering the three `GOOGLE_*` credential variables; `docs/architecture.html` generalises the tier and write-path wording from "S3" to "object storage", describes the namespace root as `{FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI}/{namespace}/`, and documents the concurrency model covering both `If-None-Match: *` (S3 family) and the generation precondition (native GCS); `docs/api.html` softens the namespace-prefix and delete/error wording from S3-specific to backend-agnostic; `docs/quickstart.html`, `docs/deployment.html`, and `docs/monitoring.html` are skimmed for incidental S3-specific phrasing and updated where it would mislead a GCS operator. Metric names like `firnflow_s3_requests_total` are kept unchanged for dashboard continuity, with an inline note that the counter now covers all backends. Refs #37.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- Bearer-token authentication on the REST API. Two static keys, both opt-in via env: `FIRNFLOW_API_KEY` for the read/write tier (`upsert`, `query`, `list`, `warmup`) and `FIRNFLOW_ADMIN_API_KEY` for the destructive tier (`delete`, `index`, `fts-index`, `scalar-index`, `compact`). When neither is set the API stays open with a single startup `WARN`, preserving 0.4.x behaviour for existing dev compose stacks. Header format is the standard `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; comparisons are constant-time via `subtle::ConstantTimeEq`. If only `FIRNFLOW_API_KEY` is configured, it authorises admin routes too (single-key fallback). Status codes: missing/malformed/unknown token → 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="firnflow"`; valid token but insufficient scope → 403. **Service-level only** — any holder of `FIRNFLOW_API_KEY` can read or write any namespace. Per-tenant namespace isolation requires an authenticating gateway in front of firnflow.
- Optional bearer-token gate for `/metrics` via `FIRNFLOW_METRICS_TOKEN`. Same Bearer parser, so Prometheus's `bearer_token` / `bearer_token_file` scrape config works unchanged. `/metrics` stays public when the token is unset (preserves 0.4.x behaviour).
- Optional per-principal token-bucket rate limiting via `tower-governor`. `FIRNFLOW_RATE_LIMIT_RPS` (sustained rate) and `FIRNFLOW_RATE_LIMIT_BURST` (default 30) bucket on the validated `Principal` extension that the auth middleware attaches; this means a bogus token never reaches the limiter — auth has already returned 401 — so an attacker cannot mint fresh buckets by rotating tokens. `/health` and `/metrics` are exempt. Rejected requests return 429 with `Retry-After`.
- Optional pre-auth IP-keyed limiter via `FIRNFLOW_PREAUTH_IP_LIMIT_RPS`. Wraps the protected sub-router as the outermost layer and caps credential-stuffing throughput per peer IP. Off by default because most operators front firnflow with a CDN or API gateway that already does this.
- `FIRNFLOW_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` (default `false`). When `true`, the IP extractor trusts the leftmost entry in `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP`. Default is to read peer IP from the connection only — a deployment exposed directly cannot have its bucket key forged.
- New Prometheus counter `firnflow_auth_rejections_total{reason}` with reasons `missing` (no Authorization header), `invalid` (header present, token does not match), `forbidden` (valid token, insufficient scope), `rate_limited` (shed by either limiter). Use this to detect misconfigured keys after a rotation or credential-stuffing pressure.
- Startup-time validation: `firnflow-api` refuses to start when `FIRNFLOW_API_KEY` and `FIRNFLOW_ADMIN_API_KEY` are configured to the same value. The auth middleware checks the admin key first, so identical bytes would silently classify every authenticated request as admin and collapse the scope split. The error message tells the operator to either set a distinct admin key or unset `FIRNFLOW_ADMIN_API_KEY` to engage the documented single-key fallback. Validation runs at the very top of `build_state`, before metrics, manager, cache directory, or cache initialisation, so a config error is reported directly rather than being masked by an unrelated infrastructure failure.
- `AppConfig` now has a custom `Debug` impl that redacts values for credential-bearing entries in `storage_options` (anything whose key contains `secret`, `password`, `token`, `access_key`, or `credential`, case-insensitive). `aws_secret_access_key` and `aws_access_key_id` are masked; non-sensitive options like `aws_endpoint`, `aws_region`, and `allow_http` remain visible because they are useful for diagnosing config. The integration regression test now exercises a populated `storage_options` map to pin this.
- Closes #2.

### Changed
- `ApiError` is now an enum with explicit `Core(FirnflowError)`, `Unauthorized`, `Forbidden`, and `RateLimited(Duration)` variants. `From<FirnflowError>` is preserved so handlers continue to use `?` against core errors. Not a public stability commitment, but flagged for downstream callers.
- `AppState` carries an `Arc<AuthConfig>` plus a `RateLimitSettings` field. Integration tests construct `AppState` through a single `tests/common::test_state()` helper rather than the previous per-test inline literal — adding a future field is a one-line change instead of ten.
- `firnflow-api` now mounts the router with `into_make_service_with_connect_info::<SocketAddr>()` so the auth middleware and IP rate limiter can read peer IPs.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- `POST /ns/{namespace}/scalar-index` — builds a BTree scalar index on the reserved `_ingested_at` column asynchronously (returns 202 Accepted). With the index in place, `/list` cursor pages do an index range scan instead of a full-fragment scan and the leading `ORDER BY _ingested_at` short-circuits the in-memory sort. The build runs in a tokio task and reports duration via `firnflow_index_build_duration_seconds{kind="scalar"}`. Idempotent (repeat calls rebuild in place); the cached connection/table handle is evicted on success in line with the existing manifest-bump rationale used by `/index` and `/fts-index`. `POST /compact` already runs `optimize_indices` after the file compaction step, so the BTree absorbs new rows incrementally — no separate rebuild trigger is needed after compaction. Closes #24.
- DigitalOcean Spaces is a validated storage backend. The `If-None-Match: *` pre-flight returns 412 on the second PUT and a 100-iteration concurrent-writer stress run produced 800/800 rows on every iteration with zero discrepancies, validated against `firn-sample-bucket` in the London (`lon1`) region. Per-iteration wall time is ~3.10 s, the same performance class as AWS `eu-west-1` and the fastest non-AWS backend tested. The README compatibility matrix is updated; deployment requires the regional endpoint (`https://<region>.digitaloceanspaces.com`) and path-style addressing, the same client-side quirk that affects Cloudflare R2 and Tigris on `object_store` 0.12. Test functions live alongside the existing per-provider blocks in `crates/firnflow-core/tests/s3_conditional_writes.rs` and `crates/firnflow-core/tests/lance_concurrent_writes.rs`. Closes #29.

### Changed
- Tigris is now a validated storage backend. The 2026-04-17 concurrent-stress failure (silent write loss under contention on both dual-region and single-region buckets) was fixed upstream. A 2026-04-19 re-run of the 100-iteration stress passed cleanly on both `firn-tigris-bucket` (dual-region, 375 s) and `firn-tigris-single-region` (291 s). The README compatibility matrix is updated.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- `GET /ns/{namespace}/list` — a narrow, cursor-paginated endpoint for "recent content" flows. Ordered by a new reserved system column `_ingested_at` (microsecond timestamp, populated at first write, never mutated). Supports `order_by=_ingested_at` only in v1, `order=asc|desc`, `limit` (default 50, capped at 500), and an opaque hex cursor. Bypasses the foyer cache so pagination tails do not pollute hot query entries (issue #22).
- `NamespaceManager::list` + `encode_list_cursor` / `decode_list_cursor` helpers. Cursor format is a 32-char hex encoding of `(timestamp_micros, id)` for stable continuation under concurrent writes.
- `FirnflowError::Unsupported` variant mapped to HTTP 501 for namespaces whose tables pre-date the `_ingested_at` column.
- `firnflow_s3_requests_total{operation="list"}` is now recorded for every list call so `/list` participates in the cost-visibility story even though it bypasses `NamespaceService`.

### Changed
- `NamespaceManager` now caches `(dim, has_ingested_at)` per namespace (`schema_info` replaces the old `dims` DashMap). Existing namespaces without `_ingested_at` continue to accept upserts against their original schema; only the `/list` endpoint rejects them with 501.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Per-namespace connection pool inside `NamespaceManager`. The
  `lancedb::Connection` and `Table` handle for each namespace are
  cached after the first open and reused across subsequent
  upserts, queries, index builds, and compactions. The pool is
  evicted on `delete`, `create_index`, `create_fts_index`, and
  `compact`; ordinary append-only upserts do not evict. First run
  against MinIO measured a cold upsert at ~108 ms and the warm
  upsert at ~8 ms on the same hardware (issue #1).
- New Prometheus gauge `firnflow_cached_handles` exposed at
  `/metrics`. Compared against `firnflow_active_namespaces` it
  surfaces namespaces that will still pay the cold-open cost on
  their next request.
- Documentation updates in `docs/monitoring.html`,
  `docs/architecture.html`, and `docs/quickstart.html` describing
  the pool and the new gauge.

### Changed
- `NamespaceManager::new()` now takes `Arc<CoreMetrics>` as a
  third argument so the manager can drive the pool gauge. Every
  call site in `firnflow-api`, the bench harness, and the
  integration tests updated accordingly.
- License corrected to Apache-2.0 across the repository. The
  `LICENSE` file now matches the `license = "Apache-2.0"`
  declaration already present in the workspace `Cargo.toml`,
  replacing the MIT text that was committed in error.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-13

Initial public release. The repository had been under active
development through phases 1 through 8 before being made public;
`v0.1.0` marks the first tagged artifact.

### Highlights present at 0.1.0
- Multi-tenant S3-backed vector and full-text search engine
  combining LanceDB (vector + BM25 on object storage) with foyer
  (RAM + NVMe hybrid cache) behind an axum REST API.
- Namespace manager with per-namespace vector dimensions, lazy
  namespace creation, and full cleanup on delete.
- Cache-aside read path with after-success invalidation. Keyed on
  `(namespace, generation, query_hash)` using a per-namespace
  atomic generation counter for O(1) invalidation.
- bincode-2 serialisation path for cached result sets with a
  100-result p99 round-trip well inside the 1 ms budget.
- IVF_PQ vector indexing via `POST /ns/{ns}/index`, BM25 FTS
  indexing via `POST /ns/{ns}/fts-index`, compaction via
  `POST /ns/{ns}/compact`. All three run as non-blocking
  background tasks and return 202.
- Three query modes: vector-only, FTS-only, and hybrid via
  Reciprocal Rank Fusion.
- Prometheus metrics surface: cache hits/misses, S3 request
  counter, query and write duration histograms, index-build and
  compaction duration histograms, active-namespaces gauge.
- Published Docker image at `ghcr.io/gordonmurray/firnflow` and
  documentation at https://firnflow.io.
- Validated against MinIO and real AWS S3 in `eu-west-1`. Honest
  benchmark at dim=1536, 100k rows available at
  `bench/results/cold_vs_warm_aws.md`.
