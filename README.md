# Firn

**Firn** is a high-performance, multi-tenant vector and full-text search engine backed by object storage (AWS S3, MinIO, Cloudflare R2, Tigris, DigitalOcean Spaces, Google Cloud Storage). It is designed as a credible open-source alternative to turbopuffer, proving that a professional-grade tiered storage architecture (**RAM → NVMe → object storage**) is achievable entirely from open-source components. See [Storage backends](#storage-backends) for the full compatibility matrix.

The cost efficiency of object storage with the speed of local RAM. A multi-tenant vector and full-text search engine backed by any S3-compatible bucket or native Google Cloud Storage. Built with LanceDB and Foyer for microsecond-scale search latency on top of object storage.

## 25 Seconds to 72 Microseconds

On real-world cloud infrastructure (AWS S3), a raw linear scan of 100,000 vectors can take **25 seconds** per query. By pairing **LanceDB** with a tiered **foyer** (RAM + NVMe) cache, **Firn** collapses that bottleneck:

*   **Cold Query (S3 Linear Scan):** ~25.1s
*   **Cold Query (ANN Indexed):** ~979ms (**25x faster**)
*   **Warm Query (Internal Engine):** **~72µs** (**350,000x faster**)
*   **End-to-End HTTP (Warm):** **< 5ms** (including network RTT and JSON overhead)

Every cache hit results in **zero** object-storage requests, directly reducing your cloud bill while providing "instant" search response times.

### Demo

Cold query, warm query, full-text search, and cache proof, all in 60 seconds. This demo runs against local MinIO; on real AWS S3 the cold query takes 25 seconds instead of 109ms, making the cache speedup even more dramatic.

## Architecture

**Firn** is built on a "Tiered Storage" philosophy:

1.  **L1: RAM Cache** (via foyer): Sub-microsecond access for the most frequent queries.
2.  **L2: NVMe Cache** (via foyer): Fast, durable cache for high-volume search results.
3.  **L3: Object Storage** (via LanceDB on AWS S3 / MinIO / R2 / Tigris / Spaces / native GCS): The "Source of Truth" where every namespace is isolated under its own object-storage prefix.

### Key Technologies
*   **axum:** High-performance async REST API.
*   **LanceDB:** Vector and BM25 search engine that runs natively on object storage.
*   **foyer:** Advanced hybrid cache (RAM + NVMe) with LFU/LRU eviction.
*   **Prometheus:** Full operational visibility into cache hits, misses, and object-storage request savings.

## Storage backends

Firn's correctness depends on the underlying object store offering a strictly linearisable compare-and-swap across concurrent writers. LanceDB's commit protocol uses this guarantee to serialise manifest updates, so a backend that ignores or incorrectly handles the conditional-write contract will silently lose writes. For S3-family backends the contract is `If-None-Match: *`; for native Google Cloud Storage it is the generation precondition (`x-goog-if-generation-match: 0` on the GCS XML API), which lancedb's `gcs` feature wires through transparently. Every provider below has been tested with the same shape: a sequential conditional-PUT pre-flight, an 8-writer x 100-row concurrent stress, and (for the passing backends) 100 consecutive runs of that stress against a real bucket. The test harness is in `crates/firnflow-core/tests/`.

| Provider | Supported | Reason |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| **AWS S3** (`eu-west-1` validated) | ✅ | Strict CAS, clean pass on 100-run stress. |
| **MinIO** (self-hosted / local) | ✅ | Reference implementation for the S3 protocol; clean pass on 100-run stress. |
| **Cloudflare R2** | ✅ | `If-None-Match: *` honoured correctly; 100-run stress clean. Per-iteration latency is roughly 7x AWS due to R2's multi-region commit path, but correctness is what the gate checks. Zero egress makes this the most interesting non-AWS target. Use path-style addressing. |
| **Backblaze B2** (S3 compat layer) | ❌ | Returns `HTTP 501 NotImplemented` on the first PutObject with `If-None-Match: *`. B2's native API supports conditional writes via `X-Bz-*` headers, but the S3-compat gateway does not translate them. Loud failure: easy to detect, not usable for Firn. |
| **Tigris** (dual-region + single-region) | ✅ | `If-None-Match: *` honoured on concurrent commits; 100-run stress clean on both dual-region and single-region buckets as of 2026-04-19 after an upstream CAS fix. Use path-style addressing on `t3.storage.dev`. |
| **DigitalOcean Spaces** (`lon1` validated) | ✅ | Strict CAS, 100-run stress clean. Per-iteration latency ~3.10s, in the same band as AWS `eu-west-1` and the fastest non-AWS backend tested. Use the regional endpoint (`https://<region>.digitaloceanspaces.com`), not the virtual-hosted form, with path-style addressing. |
| **Google Cloud Storage** (native, `europe-west1` validated) | ✅ | Routed through lancedb's native `gcs` feature and `object_store::gcp`, which use the GCS XML API's generation precondition (`x-goog-if-generation-match: 0`) instead of `If-None-Match: *`. 100-run Lance-level concurrent-writer stress passes cleanly against `firn-gcs-bucket-europe-west1`; an 8-writer barrier-gated contended-key microstress and a sequential pre-flight also pass — see `crates/firnflow-core/tests/lance_concurrent_writes.rs` and `s3_conditional_writes.rs`. Auth is service-account JSON via the standard `GOOGLE_*` environment variables. Use a `gs://...` URI; the GCS S3-interop endpoint (reached via an `s3://` URI plus a custom `GCS_ENDPOINT`) remains unsupported because that path silently drops `If-None-Match: *` and loses writers under contention. |

The two dedicated tests live at `crates/firnflow-core/tests/s3_conditional_writes.rs` and `crates/firnflow-core/tests/lance_concurrent_writes.rs`. Both are `#[ignore]`'d and require credentials to run. If you want to evaluate a backend not in the table, copy a block from either file and point it at your own bucket.

## Backend Configuration

Backend choice is an operator config decision, not a recompile. Set `FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI` to point Firn at the bucket you want — switching between any two validated backends is an env-var change. `FIRNFLOW_S3_BUCKET` remains supported as a legacy S3-only fallback; if both are set they must agree, or startup fails.

`FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI` accepts an `s3://` or `gs://` URI with an optional fixed prefix, e.g. `s3://shared-bucket/tenants/acme/prod` or `gs://shared-bucket/tenants/acme/prod`. The prefix is useful when several deployments share a single bucket; namespace tables live at `{root}/{namespace}/`.

### AWS S3

```bash
FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI=s3://my-firn-bucket
FIRNFLOW_S3_REGION=eu-west-1
# Credentials picked up from the standard AWS chain (instance profile,
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, ~/.aws/credentials).
```

### MinIO (local / self-hosted)

```bash
FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI=s3://firnflow
FIRNFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000
FIRNFLOW_S3_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
FIRNFLOW_S3_SECRET_KEY=minioadmin
```

### Cloudflare R2

```bash
FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI=s3://firn-r2
FIRNFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT=https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
FIRNFLOW_S3_ACCESS_KEY=<r2-access-key>
FIRNFLOW_S3_SECRET_KEY=<r2-secret-key>
FIRNFLOW_S3_REGION=auto
```

### Tigris

```bash
FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI=s3://firn-tigris
FIRNFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT=https://t3.storage.dev
FIRNFLOW_S3_ACCESS_KEY=<tigris-access-key>
FIRNFLOW_S3_SECRET_KEY=<tigris-secret-key>
FIRNFLOW_S3_REGION=auto
```

### DigitalOcean Spaces

```bash
FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI=s3://firn-spaces
FIRNFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT=https://<region>.digitaloceanspaces.com
FIRNFLOW_S3_ACCESS_KEY=<spaces-access-key>
FIRNFLOW_S3_SECRET_KEY=<spaces-secret-key>
FIRNFLOW_S3_REGION=<region>
```

### Google Cloud Storage (native)

```bash
FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI=gs://my-firn-bucket
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/etc/firnflow/gcp-sa.json
# Alternatively: GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=/etc/firnflow/gcp-sa.json,
# or GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=<inline service-account JSON>.
```

Use `gs://...` rather than reaching for the GCS S3-interop endpoint — the interop path silently drops `If-None-Match: *` and is not supported.

## Features

*   **Multi-tenant by Design:** Each namespace maps to an isolated object-storage prefix under the configured `FIRNFLOW_STORAGE_URI` (e.g. `s3://bucket/namespace/` or `gs://bucket/namespace/`) with near-zero idle cost.
*   **Instant Invalidation:** A "Generation Counter" strategy ensures that after a write, all stale search results for that namespace are invalidated in $O(1)$ time.
*   **CAS Consistency:** Verified concurrency safety using the backend's conditional-write primitive — `If-None-Match: *` for S3-family backends, the generation precondition for native GCS — to prevent data loss when multiple writers fight for the same bucket.
*   **Late-Interaction Search:** Each namespace is either single-vector (one dense vector per row) or multivector (a bag of small vectors per row, scored via MaxSim). The multivector shape is what ColBERT, ColPali, and ColQwen2 produce, and is what compositional queries like *"a man with a logo on his shirt"* need to match each element independently. See [Multivector namespaces](#multivector-namespaces) below.
*   **Zero-Copy Ready:** Optimized serialization via `bincode` (with architectural triggers to move to `rkyv` if needed).
*   **Operational Excellence:** Native Prometheus metrics tracking cache hit rates and backend request count (the primary signal for cost savings).

## Quickstart

### 1. Launch the Stack
Everything you need (MinIO storage + Firn API) is orchestrated via Docker Compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gordonmurray/firnflow
cd firnflow
docker compose up --build
```

### 2. Upsert a Vector

The API is live at `http://localhost:3000`. Save a vector to the `demo` namespace:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ns/demo/upsert \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
       "rows": [
         {"id": 1, "vector": [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]}
       ]
     }'
```

### 3. Perform a Search
Query the same namespace for the nearest neighbor:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ns/demo/query \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"vector": [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "k": 1}'
```

### 4. Check the Savings
See how much object-storage traffic you've avoided:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/metrics | grep s3_requests
```

(The metric is named `firnflow_s3_requests_total` for dashboard continuity but counts requests against whichever backend the deployment is configured for.)

## Authentication

Firn ships with optional bearer-token authentication on the REST API. Both keys are opt-in:

| Env var | Tier | Routes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `FIRNFLOW_API_KEY` | read/write | `upsert`, `query`, `list`, `warmup` |
| `FIRNFLOW_ADMIN_API_KEY` | admin (destructive) | `delete`, `index`, `fts-index`, `scalar-index`, `compact` |
| `FIRNFLOW_METRICS_TOKEN` | metrics | `/metrics` (otherwise public) |

Header format on every protected request: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

If `FIRNFLOW_ADMIN_API_KEY` is unset, the read/write key authorises admin routes too (single-key fallback). Set both keys to a different value to lock destructive operations behind a separate credential. If neither key is set the API stays open and logs a single startup `WARN` — this preserves the default-open posture of the local-dev compose stack.

```bash
export FIRNFLOW_API_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ns/demo/upsert \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRNFLOW_API_KEY" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"rows": [...]}'
```

**This is service-level authentication.** Any holder of `FIRNFLOW_API_KEY` can read or write any namespace; any holder of `FIRNFLOW_ADMIN_API_KEY` can additionally delete or rebuild indexes on any namespace. If you need per-tenant namespace isolation, place Firn behind an authenticating gateway that enforces tenant-to-namespace authorisation. See [`docs/configuration.html`](https://firnflow.io/configuration.html) for the rate-limiting knobs (`FIRNFLOW_RATE_LIMIT_RPS`, `FIRNFLOW_RATE_LIMIT_BURST`, `FIRNFLOW_PREAUTH_IP_LIMIT_RPS`) and the `FIRNFLOW_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` switch for deployments behind a load balancer.

## API Surface

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/health` | `GET` | open | Liveness check |
| `/metrics` | `GET` | metrics or open | Prometheus exposition format |
| `/ns/{ns}` | `DELETE` | admin | Removes all data (object storage + cache) for a namespace |
| `/ns/{ns}/upsert` | `POST` | read/write | Insert/update vectors and data |
| `/ns/{ns}/query` | `POST` | read/write | Vector, FTS, or hybrid search |
| `/ns/{ns}/list` | `GET` | read/write | Cursor-paginated list ordered by `_ingested_at` |
| `/ns/{ns}/warmup` | `POST` | read/write | Non-blocking cache pre-warm hint |
| `/ns/{ns}/index` | `POST` | admin | Build IVF_PQ vector index (async, returns 202) |
| `/ns/{ns}/fts-index` | `POST` | admin | Build BM25 full-text search index (async, returns 202) |
| `/ns/{ns}/scalar-index` | `POST` | admin | Build BTree index on `_ingested_at` to accelerate `/list` (async, returns 202) |
| `/ns/{ns}/compact` | `POST` | admin | Compact and prune data files (async, returns 202) |

Auth column: `open` = no header required; `read/write` = `FIRNFLOW_API_KEY` (or `FIRNFLOW_ADMIN_API_KEY`); `admin` = `FIRNFLOW_ADMIN_API_KEY` if configured, otherwise `FIRNFLOW_API_KEY` via the single-key fallback. `/metrics` is `metrics` when `FIRNFLOW_METRICS_TOKEN` is set, otherwise `open`.

## Multivector namespaces

Each namespace is one of two **vector kinds**, fixed by the shape of the first upsert and immutable thereafter:

- **Single-vector** (the default). One dense vector per row. Used for CLIP, OpenAI `text-embedding-3-*`, sentence-transformers — anything that pools a piece of content into a single embedding.
- **Multivector**. A variable-length bag of small vectors per row, scored with MaxSim (for each query sub-vector, find its best match anywhere in the document, then add the matches up). This is the shape ColBERT, ColPali, and ColQwen2 produce. It is what compositional queries like *"a man with a logo on his shirt"* need to retrieve well — each element of the query gets to find its own best match independently of the others, instead of the whole query collapsing into one summary vector that smears the constituent concepts together.

The wire shape determines the kind. A single-vector upsert uses `vector: [f32, ...]`; a multivector upsert uses `vectors: [[f32, ...], [f32, ...], ...]`. Queries follow the same convention:

```bash
# single-vector upsert + query
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ns/photos/upsert \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"rows": [{"id": 1, "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]}]}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ns/photos/query \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], "k": 5}'

# multivector upsert + query
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ns/photos-mv/upsert \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"rows": [{"id": 1, "vectors": [[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8]]}]}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ns/photos-mv/query \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"vectors": [[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]], "k": 5}'
```

The handler returns 400 if the payload shape does not match the namespace's kind — for example a `vector:` payload sent to a multivector namespace, or vice versa. The error response names the expected shape.

**Constraints to know before adopting multivector:**

- **Cosine only.** Lance's late-interaction index supports cosine distance exclusively. Firn does not expose a per-request metric option on the API surface; `create_index` constructs the IVF_PQ builder with cosine internally for multivector namespaces and with L2 for single-vector namespaces.
- **Storage is materially larger.** A single-vector CLIP entry is ~2 KB per row. A multivector ColPali entry is closer to ~500 KB per row (around 1030 sub-vectors × 128 floats). Budget S3 footprint and index-build wall-clock time accordingly.
- **Build an index for tractable latency.** Lance answers multivector queries on an un-indexed namespace via brute-force scan — fine for tiny development corpora, painfully slow on anything real. Build the IVF_PQ index (`POST /ns/{ns}/index`) after the first batch of upserts. Same trade-off as single-vector queries.
- **The result cache does not accelerate novel multivector queries.** Every tokenised query is unique, so cache hit rate is near zero on this path. The cache continues to accelerate exact-repeat queries — useful for benchmarks and synthetic load, not for production retrieval workloads.
- **New-namespace only.** A namespace that started as single-vector cannot be converted to multivector in place. Create a new namespace with a multivector first upsert.

**Encoders that produce vectors in the right shape:** ColBERTv2 (text passages), ColPali (documents, slides, PDFs), ColQwen2 / ColIDEFICS (multimodal — natural images and documents). Firn stays model-agnostic: the caller computes the bag of small vectors and POSTs it.

## Development and Benchmarking

**Firn** uses a containerized toolchain. No local Rust installation is required.

```bash
# Run the full test suite (requires MinIO)
./scripts/cargo test --workspace -- --ignored

# Run the cold-vs-warm latency benchmark
./scripts/cargo run --release -p firnflow-bench
```

Benchmark results are committed at `bench/results/cold_vs_warm.md`.
