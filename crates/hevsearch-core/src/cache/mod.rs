//! A single foyer `HybridCache` (RAM + NVMe) is shared across all

//! invalidation on writes O(1). The generation-counter approach
//! avoids the memory-growth cost of tracking every live cache key
//! explicitly, has no race window between cache population and key
//! registration, and is O(1) on write regardless of how many cached
//! queries exist for a namespace.
