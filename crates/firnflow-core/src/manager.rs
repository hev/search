//! Namespace manager — the production shim over lancedb.
//!
//! Each namespace maps to its own Lance table rooted at
//! `s3://{bucket}/{namespace}/`.
//!
//! **Per-namespace dimensions:** the manager no longer
//! carries a global `vector_dim`. Instead, dimensions are:
//!
//! - **inferred** from the first upsert into a fresh namespace
//!   (row[0]'s vector length), or
//! - **read from the Lance table schema** when re-opening an
//!   existing namespace.
//!
//! Resolved schema facts — the vector dimension and whether the
//! table carries the `_ingested_at` system column — are cached in a
//! `DashMap<NamespaceId, NamespaceSchemaInfo>` so the schema-read /
//! first-row-inference happens at most once per namespace per process
//! lifetime. Entries stay until the process restarts or the namespace
//! is deleted (in which case the stale entry is evicted lazily on
//! next use).
//!
//! **Connection pooling (issue #1):** each namespace's
//! `lancedb::Connection` + `lancedb::Table` are cached in a
//! `DashMap<NamespaceId, NamespaceHandle>` after the first
//! successful open. Subsequent upserts, queries, index builds, and
//! compactions reuse the cached handle, skipping the
//! S3-credential-resolution and manifest-read cost of a fresh
//! `lancedb::connect()` + `open_table()`.
//!
//! The pool is invalidated on namespace delete and on operations
//! that change the table's manifest (index build, compaction). A
//! regular upsert does **not** evict — a merge-insert write commits
//! through the cached handle and its result is visible to subsequent
//! reads on that same handle.
